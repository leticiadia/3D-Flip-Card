## 💻 Description

<p>3D Flip Card is an effect built with CSS. This effect causes the card or element to rotate.</p>

## 📖 About 3D Flip Card

<p>
    The purpose of using this effect on the card was to learn more about 3D animations and transitions with CSS.

## 📝 I learned

<p>I will briefly tell you about some things I learned doing this 3D Flip Card project. Before explaining how I learned it is important to talk about what the Flip Cards effect is.</p>

### What is the Flip Cards effect?

> The 3D flip card effect allows us to make an element rotate.

### How so 🤔?

<p>Think like you have a card right, that card has the front and the back right?</p>
<p>If you want to see the back of the card, you'll need to rotate it so you can see what's behind it. And it is precisely this effect that I created on the card.</p>

### 3D Flip Card

<p>Now that we understand a little bit about the Flip card effect, I will briefly explain what I learned about creating this effect.</p>

#### To create this effect, I needed to use some properties:

- **perspective:** This property allows us to create a depth space, that is, the distance between the element and the user.
- **transform-style:** This property defines whether the child elements are in 3D space. The transform-style property has a value, called preserve-3d, which allows us to position child elements in 3D space.
- **transform:** This property allows us to make the element spin, for example. And to do that, we need a function of the tranform property itself called rotate(), which allows us to rotate the elements on the X or Y axis.
